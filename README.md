# Project description

this project was designed to test my abilities of javascript and use my knowledge of jquery day.js and javascript along with html and css to build a functional typical workday scheduler that saves the information that i input onto the webpage on my local storage along with creating a clock that goes along with our local time. 

when doing this project the reason i used the technologies i used such as day.js was so that i can use third party apis to bring in data for date and time and jquery so that i can transverse the document and manipulate it within js.


when starting this project i was at a lose for how to start or where to start at first i was confused as to what was asked of me until i had asked for help then after breaking down the project into chuncks it became easier for me. one of the biggest challanges i faced when doing this project was working with local storage and figuring out what i had to write to have everything that was being saved appear on my screen along with figuring out what to use from the dayjs documentation. another challange i had faced was when writing the code initally it was very sloppy so i had an error where i had extra brackets and paranthesies that were causeing issues within the code and after awhile of not being able to find the issue i rewrote the code but neater so i didnt run into the issue again.

# How to install and run the project
